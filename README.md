# David Salomón's up35mm script

## The Repository

Here you will find an automated script that clones my [.files repo](https://github.com/david35mm/.files) and applies some other changes to the system. Lately I've been maintaining two scripts, one for Fedora and another one for Arch, both of them I would consider as usable but there are certain bugs nonetheless, you are free to use them but I'm considering them as _legacy_.

If you want to contribute to this repository I would prefer you to do so in the unified script (wich is still in alpha). The contents of this repository are freely available for everyone to view, download and modify, more information on the [License](#license) down below.

You are completely free of making a pull request, any contribution will be greatly appreciated.

## How to run the script?

I guess you already now what dotfiles are, if not head [here](https://github.com/david35mm/.files#the-repository). Aside of cloning my [.files repo](https://github.com/david35mm/.files), some of the other options include a better DNF/Pacman config and aliases, automatic networking setup, installation of some window managers and the software selection I use (I'm thinking about removing that last thing cause maybe it's too much bloat on to your system)... among other things. If you want to run the script in your system <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+V</kbd> on your terminal this command:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/david35mm/up35mm/main/up35mm.sh | sh
```

## Who is David Salomón?

I am an Electronic Engineering student, passionate about computers and everything related to it. I was born in [Bogotá](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogot%C3%A1), the capital city of the South American country [Colombia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia). My nickname in almost all of the social media I am registered on is david.35mm. Why? In the last few years, one of my main hobbies has been photography, I even started a small YouTube channel. There I shared some tips and explain some concepts about photography, you are free to check out my videos but... as a native Spanish speaker all of my videos are going to be in that language.

The 35mm on my nickname is because of the measurement of the photographic film used in the past. As a photography enthusiast I also have my own portfolio, as you can see I love portraits and thus I base almost all of my work on this type of art.

## A one last thing

If you are wondering what GNU/Linux distribution I use, it has been Arch for the last year. I'm thinking on going back to Fedora and try the rawhide edition. Want to talk with me (or even practise your Spanish)? DM me over on Instagram.
